## 5. Architecture and Design

- **Hexagonal Architecture:** Separation of domain logic, infrastructure, and user interface for maintainability and testability.

### Domain Model

- **Database:** Collection of chess games.

- **Move:** Represents a single move, including piece, start/end positions, and annotations.
- **Piece:** Type (pawn, knight, etc.) and color (white/black).
- **Board:** Represents the chessboard and all piece positions.
- **LegalMove:** Encapsulates a legal move and its effect on the board state.
- **Position:** Specific square on the board, with coordinates and piece.

### Considerations

For the PGN we want to use a recursive descent parser.
